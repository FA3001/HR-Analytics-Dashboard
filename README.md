# HR-Analytics-Dashboard

### Executive Summary
Using Tableau i built an HR Analytics Dashboard to provide HR managers with clear, data-driven insights into their workforce. It features a high-level Summary View for strategic metrics and a detailed Employee Records View for individual analysis, enabling better talent management and decision-making.

### Business Problem
HR managers lack a centralized, visual tool to quickly understand key workforce metrics, leading to inefficient analysis of hiring, diversity, and compensation. This dashboard solves that by providing an interactive dashboard to answer different questions.

### Dashboard Features
1. **Summary View**
     - Overview: Headcount metrics, hiring/termination trends, and employee breakdowns by department, title, and location (HQ vs.           Branches).
  
    - Demographics: Gender ratio, age group distribution, education levels, and the correlation between education and performance.
  
    - Income Analysis: Salary comparison across education levels and genders, and the correlation between age and salary by             department.
